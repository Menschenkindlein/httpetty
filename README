HTTPETTY TestServer

BUILDING

Dependencies - netty 4.*

May be builded using Maven (pom.xml included).

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

To delay response on /hello route different group of executors was used.
Delaying is performed via 'schedule' method of ChannelContext's executor.

Redirect is just HTTP Found response with custom LOCATION header.

Statistic is gathered from 'business logic' handler TestServerHandler,
from Redirect route and via StatisticHandler which should count read-written
bytes.  Note, that in 16 last connections, the last one is in the end :)

PROBLEMS

- Strange speed values; May be solved (read+written/time)
- Strange behaviour of delaying when using browser:
  - if you ask server many times on the same window - tasks are solved in
    parallel (same using wget);
  - if you ask server from two different windows - tasks are solved
    sequentially, and there are three channels created.

ADDITIONAL FILES

1. status.page.txt - contains response of the server on /status request
2. ab.command.result.txt - contains the result of executing
   ab -c 100 -n 10000 http://localhost:8080/status
